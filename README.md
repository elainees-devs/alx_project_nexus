## üìå Project Objective

This repository documents my major learnings from the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering program**. It serves as a knowledge hub showcasing backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices through real-world applications.

---

## üöÄ Overview of ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The **ProDev Backend track** equips learners with practical backend development skills by combining theory, projects, and collaboration.

### Key Technologies Covered

* **Python** ‚Äì Core programming for backend logic
* **Django** ‚Äì High-level web framework for rapid development
* **Django REST Framework (DRF)** ‚Äì Building RESTful APIs

### Important Backend Concepts Learned

* **Database Design** ‚Äì Normalization, indexing, and schema optimization
* **Asynchronous Programming** ‚Äì Improving concurrency with async/await
* **Caching Strategies** ‚Äì Boosting performance with Redis/memory caching
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ‚Äì Secure user authentication/authorization
* **API Documentation** ‚Äì Clear communication via Swagger/OpenAPI

### Challenges & Solutions

* **Challenge:** Complex query optimization for large datasets

  * **Solution:** Applied indexing, query filtering, and caching
* **Challenge:** Handling secure authentication/authorization

  * **Solution:** Implemented JWT with role-based access control
* **Challenge:** Seamless frontend-backend collaboration

  * **Solution:** Created well-documented REST/GraphQL APIs and shared Swagger docs

### Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* Write **modular, maintainable code** following Django best practices
* Always **document APIs** for frontend developers
* Use **Git commit conventions** to keep history clean and meaningful
* Embrace **collaboration and peer reviews** for better project outcomes

## üóÇ Database Schema (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) below illustrates the relationships between the main models (`users`, `companies`, `jobs`, `applications`, `notifications`, `payments`, `request_logs`, `rate_limit`).

## üîí Security

Please see the [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) file for details on supported versions and how to report vulnerabilities.
## üì§ Deployment

* **Deployment:** Backend API hosted with integrated Swagger docs in render
* **Documentation** ‚Äì Accessible at [https://alx-project-nexus-mtwe.onrender.com/swagger](https://alx-project-nexus-mtwe.onrender.com/swagger)

* **HTTPS Enforcement:** All production traffic redirected to HTTPS

## ‚ö° Local Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd jobsboard
```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create `.env` in the project root:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/jobsboard
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

5. **Apply Migrations**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

6. **Create Superuser**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. **Collect Static Files**

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

8. **Run Development Server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## üß™ Running Tests

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Tests cover all apps: `companies`, `jobs`, `applications`, `notifications`, `payments`, `request_logs`, and `rate_limit`.

---

## üìå Notes

* Ensure `media/` and `static/` folders exist for file uploads
* Indexes and unique constraints optimize query performance
* Rate limiting protects APIs from excessive requests
* Request logging captures API usage for auditing
* HTTPS enforced for all external URLs and requests
