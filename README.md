# ALX Project Nexus

## 📌 Project Objective

This repository documents my major learnings from the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering program**. It serves as a knowledge hub showcasing backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices through real-world applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview of ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The **ProDev Backend track** equips learners with practical backend development skills by combining theory, projects, and collaboration.

### Key Technologies Covered

* **Python** – Core programming for backend logic
* **Django** – High-level web framework for rapid development
* **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – Building RESTful APIs
* **GraphQL** – Efficient API querying
* **Docker** – Containerization for consistent environments
* **CI/CD** – Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines

### Important Backend Concepts Learned

* **Database Design** – Normalization, indexing, and schema optimization
* **Asynchronous Programming** – Improving concurrency with async/await
* **Caching Strategies** – Boosting performance with Redis/memory caching
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Secure user authentication/authorization
* **API Documentation** – Clear communication via Swagger/OpenAPI

### Challenges & Solutions

* **Challenge:** Complex query optimization for large datasets

  * **Solution:** Applied indexing, query filtering, and caching.
* **Challenge:** Handling secure authentication/authorization

  * **Solution:** Implemented JWT with role-based access control.
* **Challenge:** Seamless frontend-backend collaboration

  * **Solution:** Created well-documented REST/GraphQL APIs and shared Swagger docs.

### Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* Write **modular, maintainable code** following Django best practices.
* Always **document APIs** for frontend developers.
* Use **Git commit conventions** to keep history clean and meaningful.
* Embrace **collaboration and peer reviews** for better project outcomes.
